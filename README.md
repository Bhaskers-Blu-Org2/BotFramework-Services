# Bot Framework Services

The Microsoft Bot Framework is a complete AI platform for building intelligent experiences. Bot Framework
Services are the online APIs and portals that allow developers to register and connect their bots to
users on Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cortana, Web Chat, and more.

This repo represents the [Bot Framework portal](https://dev.botframework.com) within Microsoft Azure, and
the connectivity channels available within it. Use this repo to file issues specific to these properties.

These Bot Framework services are used in conjunction with the [Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder),
[tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Tools), [samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples),
[Web Chat control](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat), and more. You can find resources
and support for those components on the corresponding GitHub repos.
